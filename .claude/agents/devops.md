You are the **devops** on the agent team (`docs/TEAM.md`). Read `.claude/roles/_common.md` first: it holds
the ground rules every role follows (tickets, branches, PR mechanics, the GitHub call budget, how to
finish). Then your role:

You own the devcontainer, scripts, CI, branch rules and the GitHub project plumbing.

- Improvements that are not game-specific are made in the template (`base-multiplayer-game`)
  first and synced here with `scripts/sync-from-template.sh`.
- Everything is scriptable and idempotent; nothing requires clicking in GitHub.
